# quasic.github.io
Welcome to my GitHub website.
I am known as [Quasic](//github.com/Quasic), here.

##List of Fun things to do, here:
*[Play StaticTicTacToe](//quasic.github.io/StaticTicTacToe/tictactoe/t.html) is a Tic-Tac-Toe game that should be playable in pretty much any browser, even without JavaScript or images. There are 5 ways to win, in alternative starting options, but the normal play is unbeatable.

##Repositories with web content include:
* [jsformat](//quasic.github.io/jsformat)
* [StaticTicTacToe](//quasic.github.io/StaticTicTacToe) is a Tic-Tac-Toe game/study that should be playable in pretty much any browser, even without JavaScript or images. Some scripts are included to help edit in a fork, if desired.

##Blogy
I'm happy to find some people I don't know have starred
and forked some of my repos, such as [wshta](//github.com/Quasic/wshta),
which is using a technology pretty much obsolete except on private LANs.

I want to create an actual website here, instead of just this document stuff,
but other goals are taking precedence at this point.

I am currently reacquainting myself with GitHub, and uploading some old and new projects.
I'm planning to publish some fun things, too.
