# quasic.github.io
Welcome to my GitHub website.
I am known as [Quasic](//github.com/Quasic), here.

##List of Fun things to do, here:
###Static
These can be cloned or downloaded to play without Internet. No special server is required, though JavaScript and image support usually are.
*Coming...
####Super Retro Static
These should provide some fun for all browsers, regardless of whether they support JavaScript, Java, Flash, frames, or even images, using only static pages that can be cloned or downloaded to play without Internet. You can save the state of any game in this list by simply bookmarking the page you are on:
*[Play StaticTicTacToe](//quasic.github.io/StaticTicTacToe/tictactoe/t.html) There are 5 ways to win, in alternative starting options, but the normal play is unbeatable.
###Server games
These require an external host, so playing a cloned repo requires extra setup. They are hosted on an external server:
*Coming...

##Repositories with web content include:
* [jsformat](//quasic.github.io/jsformat)
* [StaticTicTacToe](//quasic.github.io/StaticTicTacToe) is a Tic-Tac-Toe game/study that should be playable in pretty much any browser, even without JavaScript or images. Some scripts are included to help edit in a fork, if desired.

##Blogy
I'm happy to find some people I don't know have starred
and forked some of my repos, such as [wshta](//github.com/Quasic/wshta),
which is using a technology pretty much obsolete except on private LANs.

I want to create an actual website here, instead of just this document stuff,
but other goals are taking precedence at this point.

I am currently reacquainting myself with GitHub, and uploading some old and new projects.
I'm planning to publish some fun things, too.

###TODO list
* StaticTicTacToe
* plotFunc
* CXRPG
* GenieScenario
* bloggy subpages, maybe HTML instead of md format

* better document [lets](//GitHub.com/Quasic/lets)

##Licenses
At this point, there isn't much code, so this document is alternatively available under CC-BY-NC-4.0. However, in case I add more later, the repo is licensed under [GNU Affero GPL](LICENSE).
