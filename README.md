# quasic.github.io
Welcome to my GitHub website.
I am known as [Quasic](//github.com/Quasic), here.

## List of Fun things to do, here
### Static HTML
These can be cloned or downloaded to play without Internet. No special server is required, though JavaScript and image support usually are.

* Coming...
#### Extremely Static HTML
These should provide some fun for all browsers, regardless of whether they support JavaScript, Java, Flash, frames, or even images, using only static pages that can be cloned or downloaded to play without Internet. You can save the state of any game in this list by simply bookmarking the page you are on:

* [Play StaticTicTacToe](//quasic.github.io/StaticTicTacToe/tictactoe/t.html) There are 5 ways to win, in alternative starting options, but the normal play is unbeatable. [The repository](//github.com/Quasic/StaticTicTacToe) for this game/study includes some utility scripts I developed along with the game.

### Server games
These require an external host, so playing a cloned repo requires extra setup. They are hosted on an external server:

* Coming...

## Web content from other repositories
* [TAP](//quasic.github.io/TAP) ([repo](//GitHub.com/Quasic/TAP))
* [jsformat](//quasic.github.io/jsformat) ([repo](//GitHub.com/jsformat))

## termux
I use this terminal for Android. Here are some repo links:
* [official termux info and repos](//github.com/termux)
* [termux-home-bin](https://github.com/Quasic/termux-home-bin) a project I pretty much abandoned when my phone had weird trouble with the dialog binary, but it's now apparently a required part of the app, so I am thinking of reviving this with a recompilation or reimplementation of dialog

## Blogy
I'm happy to find some people I don't know have starred
and forked some of my repos, such as [wshta](//github.com/Quasic/wshta),
which is using a technology pretty much obsolete except on private LANs.

I want to create an actual website here, instead of just this document stuff,
but other goals are taking precedence at this point.

I am currently reacquainting myself with GitHub, and uploading some old and new projects.
I'm planning to publish some fun things, too.
