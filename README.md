# quasic.github.io
Welcome to my GitHub website.
I am known as [Quasic](//github.com/Quasic), here.
Repositories with web content include:
* [jsformat](//quasic.github.io/jsformat)

I'm happy to find some people I don't know have starred
and forked some of my repos, such as [wshta](//github.com/Quasic/wshta),
which is using a technology pretty much obsolete except on private LANs.

I want to create an actual website here, instead of just this document stuff,
but other goals are taking precedence at this point.

I am currently reacquainting myself with GitHub, and uploading some old and new projects.
I'm planning to publish some fun things, too.
